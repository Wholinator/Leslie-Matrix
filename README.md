# Leslie-Matrix
Graphical Display for computation of 5X5 Leslie Population Matrix.
Final Project for Linear Algebra 17-311 Fall 2016

This project uses C#.NET to calculate Leslie Matrices of given population parameters. It calculates eigenvalues of the matrix with techniques like root convergence algorithms and computational integrals.

I submitted the finished .exe for my grade as I was not required to write this program. Upon switching laptops over the semesters I lost the original code but found the .exe in my email. The code that has been uploaded is the decompiled source from the .exe so there may be some formatting strangeness.
